## Improve code quality with eslint (optional)

-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool that analyzes your code to quickly find problems. You can run ESLint against your plugin to find common bugs and ways to improve your code.
-   To use eslint with this project, make sure to install eslint from terminal:
    -   `npm install -g eslint`
-   To use eslint to analyze this project use this command:
    -   `eslint main.ts`
    -   eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
-   If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder:
    -   `eslint .\src\`

## Funding URL

You can include funding URLs where people who use your plugin can financially support it.

The simple way is to set the `fundingUrl` field to your link in your `manifest.json` file:

```json
{
	"fundingUrl": "https://buymeacoffee.com"
}
```

If you have multiple URLs, you can also do:

```json
{
	"fundingUrl": {
		"Buy Me a Coffee": "https://buymeacoffee.com",
		"GitHub Sponsor": "https://github.com/sponsors",
		"Patreon": "https://www.patreon.com/"
